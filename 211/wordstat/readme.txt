readme for Computer Architecture assignment 1: Wordstat (Abanoub David Awad , ada80, RUID:144003175)
This implementation takes in a text file of arbitrary character size N. goes through the file character by character and stores the characters into an array. O (N) That array is then parsed for each of the  individual words based on the given requirements. once the words are sorted they are placed into structs of type word. The final data structure is an array of word structs. Every time a word is found it is compared against all other stored words. O(N^2). As the words are compared the counters in the structs are compared until we have read everything in the text file. After we've read everything in the text file we sort all of the word structs into alphabetical order using insertion sort (N^2). the total being O(2N^2 + 2N) Dropping constants gives us a final big O of O(N^2).
