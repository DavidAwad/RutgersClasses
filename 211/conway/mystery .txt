The mystery.s file takes specific string operands and operates on them. It
does a couple things. It takes only one argument which is a continuous
string. It also performs multiple checks on the strings. If the input string
is a string of numbers the output is the same, but something different happens
if characters are entred. If a character string is entered multiple checks will occur. The first check that mystery performs is if the current character is at an even numbered position
in the string. It also checks if the current character is at a prime numbered
position. These checks determine how the output string will be formatted.
Chearacters at prime numbered positions will be lowercased, and numbers at
even numbeed positions will be uppercased, and the other portions of the
string will remain unchanged. there is however one other aspect of the code
inside of the L9 label in foo method that checks if there is a '~'(tilda) character
in the code. If there is a tilda, then the other checks will not happen and
the string will be returned exactly how it was entered. Those are the
functions of mystery.s
