## CS 518 : Operating Systems

This is the MIT xv6 teaching operating system, with edits for CS518.

The majority of code here was written by the wonderful Nick Girardo with some floundering at a keyboard from myself.

I'm quite thankful for his fantastic work and knowledge and wouldn't have passed operating systems without him.



The features we've added in different branches are support for things like user level signal handling, copy-on-write virtual memory management, semaphores, and user and kernel level preemptive threading using linux ucontexts.
enjoy~
