Homework 5

1. Both UDP messages are sent to the same process on the same port. 
It is up to the process receiving them to determine which messages are from who using IP addresses.

2. persistent connections use separate sockets identified in part by the source IP address.
The sources can then use the same port, but the payload goes to the correct corrseponding processes. 


3. assisting in detecting packet loss. 


4. 
    a - causes a time out after which all the five packets were retransmitted.

    b - no retransmission because Go-Back-N uses cumulative acknowledgements.

    c - send window size is fixed to 5 so he 6th packet never sent.
