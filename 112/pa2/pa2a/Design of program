the program is implemented in such a way that if n is the width times the height of the board, then there will be O(n) runtime complexity. We get this complexity by having one nested for loop that goes through the entire board and compares against the rules in order to figure out how to update the board. A complex series of if statements are used. This series of if statements is definitely the hardest part of the program.
the space complexity is a little bit simpler. A constant amount of space is allocated for the board, 4(ixj) because they are all characters. And then a certain amount of space based on the length of the string in the stack times 5 (using malloc).
