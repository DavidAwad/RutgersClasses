<hr class="break">
   

<p>

<span class="start"><big>T</big>his page contains links</span> to the source code for

examples appearing in the free, on-line textbook <i><a href="../index.html">Introduction 
to Programming Using Java,</a></i> Version 5.1.
You should
be able to compile these files and use them. Note however that some of these
examples depend on other source files, such as <span class="sourceref"><a href="TextIO.java">TextIO.java</a></span> 
and <span class="sourceref"><a href="MosaicPanel.java">MosaicPanel.java</a></span>,
that are not built into Java. These are classes that I have written. <b>Links to
all necessary non-standard source code files are provided below.</b> 
To use examples that depend on my classes,
you will need to compile the source code for the required classes and place the
compiled classes in the same directory with the main class file. If you are
using an integrated development environment such as Eclipse,
you can simply add any required source code files to your project.</p>


<p>Most of the solutions to end-of-chapter exercises are <b>not</b>
listed on this page. Each end-of-chapter 
exercise has its own Web page, which
discusses its solution. The source code of a sample solution of each exercise
is given in full on the solution page for that exercise. If you want to compile
the solution, you should be able to cut-and-paste the solution out of a Web
browser window and into a text editing program. (You can't cut-and-paste from
the HTML source of the solution page, since it contains extra HTML markup
commands that the Java compiler won't understand; the HTML markup does
not appear when the page is displayed in a Web browser.)</p>


<p>Note that many of these examples require Java version 5.0 or later. Some of
them were written for older versions, but will still work with current
versions. When you compile some of these older programs with current versions
of Java, you might get warnings about "deprecated" methods. These warnings are
<b>not</b> errors. When a method is deprecated, it means that it should not be used in
new code, but it has not yet been removed from the language. It is possible
that deprecated methods might be removed from the language at some future time,
but for now you just get a warning about using them.</p>

<a name="source.1">Part 1: Text-oriented Examples</a>
</h3>


<p>Many of the sample programs in the text are based on console-style
input/output, where the computer and the user type lines of text back and forth
to each other. Some of these programs use the standard output object,
<span class="code">System.out</span>, for output. Many of them use my non-standard class,
<span class="classname">TextIO</span>, for both input and output. For the programs that use <span class="classname">TextIO</span>,
one of the files <span class="sourceref"><a href="TextIO.java">TextIO.java</a></span> or TextIO.class must
be available when you compile the program, and TextIO.class must be available
when you run the program.  There is also a GUI version of TextIO;
you can find information about it at the end of this web page.</p>


<p>The programs listed here are stand-alone
applications, not applets, but I have written applets that simulate many of the
programs.  These "console applets" appear on Web pages in the on-line version
of this textbook.  They
are based on <span class="sourceref"><a href="TextIOApplet.java">TextIOApplet.java</a></span>, which provides
the same methods as <span class="classname">TextIO</span>, but in an applet instead of in
a stand-alone application.  It is straightforward to convert a
TextIO program to a TextIOApplet applet.  See the comments in the
<span class="sourceref"><a href="TextIOApplet.java">TextIOApplet.java</a></span> file for information about
how to do it.  One example of this can be found in the file
<span class="sourceref"><a href="Interest3Console.java">Interest3Console.java</a></span>.</p>

<a name="source.2">Part 2: Graphical Examples from the Text</a>
</h3>
   

<p>The following programs use a graphical user interface.  The majority of them
can be run both as stand-alone applications and as applets.  (If you have
downloaded the web site for this book, note that most of the jar files
for <a href="../c6/index.html">Chapter&nbsp;6</a> and <a href="../c12/index.html">Chapter&nbsp;12</a> are executable jar
files which can be be run as applications.)</p>
   

<ul>
   
   
<li>
<span class="sourceref"><a href="GUIDemo.java">GUIDemo.java</a></span> is a simple demonstration of some basic
   GUI components from the Swing graphical user interface library.  It appears in

   it until you learn about GUI programming.</li>
   
<li>
<span class="sourceref"><a href="StaticRects.java">StaticRects.java</a></span> is a rather useless applet that simply
   draws a static image.  It is the first example of GUI programming, in
   <a href="../c3/s8.html">Section&nbsp;3.8</a>.</li>
   
<li>
<span class="sourceref"><a href="MovingRects.java">MovingRects.java</a></span>, also from <a href="../c3/s8.html">Section&nbsp;3.8</a>, 
   draws an animated version of the image in the preceding example.  This
   applet depends on <span class="sourceref"><a href="SimpleAnimationApplet2.java">SimpleAnimationApplet2.java</a></span>, which is
   a simple framework for writing animated applets.</li>
   
<li>
<span class="sourceref"><a href="RandomMosaicWalk.java">RandomMosaicWalk.java</a></span>, a standalone
   program that displays a window full of colored squares with a moving
   disturbance, from <a href="../c4/s6.html">Section&nbsp;4.6</a>.  This program depends on
   <span class="sourceref"><a href="MosaicCanvas.java">MosaicCanvas.java</a></span> and <span class="sourceref"><a href="Mosaic.java">Mosaic.java</a></span>.</li>
   
<li>
<span class="sourceref"><a href="RandomMosaicWalk2.java">RandomMosaicWalk2.java</a></span> is a version of the previous example, 
   modified to use a few named constants. From <a href="../c4/s7.html">Section&nbsp;4.7</a>.</li>
   
<li>
<span class="sourceref"><a href="ShapeDraw.java">ShapeDraw.java</a></span>, from <a href="../c5/s5.html">Section&nbsp;5.5</a>, is an applet
   that lets the user place various shapes on a drawing area; an example of
   abstract classes, subclasses, and polymorphism.</li>
   
<li>
<span class="sourceref"><a href="HelloWorldGUI1.java">HelloWorldGUI1.java</a></span> and <span class="sourceref"><a href="HelloWorldGUI2.java">HelloWorldGUI2.java</a></span>,
   from <a href="../c6/s1.html">Section&nbsp;6.1</a>, show the message "Hello World" in a window, the first
   one by using the built-in <span class="classname">JOptionPane</span> class and the second
   by building the interface "by hand."  Another variation, <span class="sourceref"><a href="HelloWorldGUI4.java">HelloWorldGUI4.java</a></span>,
   from <a href="../c6/s4.html">Section&nbsp;6.4</a>, uses anonymous nested classes where <span class="sourceref"><a href="HelloWorldGUI1.java">HelloWorldGUI1.java</a></span>
   uses named nested classes.</li>
   
<li>
<span class="sourceref"><a href="HelloWorldApplet.java">HelloWorldApplet.java</a></span>, from <a href="../c6/s2.html">Section&nbsp;6.2</a>, defines

<li>
<span class="sourceref"><a href="HelloWorldPanel.java">HelloWorldPanel.java</a></span>, from <a href="../c6/s2.html">Section&nbsp;6.2</a>, is
   a panel that displays a message.  The panel is used as the content pane both in the
   applet <span class="sourceref"><a href="HelloWorldApplet2.java">HelloWorldApplet2.java</a></span> and in the window of the
   stand-alone application <span class="sourceref"><a href="HelloWorldGUI3.java">HelloWorldGUI3.java</a></span>.  This example
   illustrates the technique of using the same panel class in both an applet and
   a stand-alone application, a technique that will be used in many examples in the
   rest of the book.</li>
   
<li>
<span class="sourceref"><a href="ColorChooserApplet.java">ColorChooserApplet.java</a></span>, used in <a href="../c6/s3.html">Section&nbsp;6.3</a>
   to demonstrate RGB and HSB colors. This old applet uses the AWT rather than Swing
   for its user interface.  Since it is not presented as a programming example, it
   has not been revised.</li>
   
<li>
<span class="sourceref"><a href="RandomStringsApplet.java">RandomStringsApplet.java</a></span>, from <a href="../c6/s3.html">Section&nbsp;6.3</a>,
   shows 25 copies of the string "Java!" (or some other string specified in an applet
   param) in random colors and fonts.  The applet uses <span class="sourceref"><a href="RandomStringsPanel.java">RandomStringsPanel.java</a></span>
   for its content pane, and there is a stand-alone application <span class="sourceref"><a href="RandomStringsApp.java">RandomStringsApp.java</a></span>
   that uses the same panel class.</li>
   
<li>
<span class="sourceref"><a href="ClickableRandomStringsApp.java">ClickableRandomStringsApp.java</a></span>, from <a href="../c6/s4.html">Section&nbsp;6.4</a>,
   is similar to <span class="sourceref"><a href="RandomStringsApp.java">RandomStringsApp.java</a></span> except that the window is repainted
   when the user clicks the window.  This is a first example of using a mouse listener.
   The applet version is <span class="sourceref"><a href="ClickableRandomStringsApplet.java">ClickableRandomStringsApplet.java</a></span>.</li>
   
<li>
<span class="sourceref"><a href="SimpleStamper.java">SimpleStamper.java</a></span>, from <a href="../c6/s4.html">Section&nbsp;6.4</a>,
   lets the user place rectangles and ovals on a drawing area by clicking with the mouse.
   The applet version is <span class="sourceref"><a href="SimpleStamperApplet.java">SimpleStamperApplet.java</a></span>.  Both versions
   use <span class="sourceref"><a href="SimpleStamperPanel.java">SimpleStamperPanel.java</a></span> for their content panes.</li>
   
<li>
<span class="sourceref"><a href="SimpleTrackMouse.java">SimpleTrackMouse.java</a></span>, from <a href="../c6/s4.html">Section&nbsp;6.4</a>,
   shows information about mouse events.
   The applet version is <span class="sourceref"><a href="SimpleTrackMouseApplet.java">SimpleTrackMouseApplet.java</a></span>.  Both versions
   use <span class="sourceref"><a href="SimpleTrackMousePanel.java">SimpleTrackMousePanel.java</a></span> for their content panes.</li>
   
<li>
<span class="sourceref"><a href="SimplePaint.java">SimplePaint.java</a></span>, from <a href="../c6/s4.html">Section&nbsp;6.4</a>,
   lets the user draw curves in a drawing area and select the drawing color from a

<li>
<span class="sourceref"><a href="RandomArtPanel.java">RandomArtPanel.java</a></span>, from <a href="../c6/s5.html">Section&nbsp;6.5</a>, shows
   a new random "artwork" every four seconds.  This is an example of using a <span class="classname">Timer</span>.
   Used in an applet version of the program, <span class="sourceref"><a href="RandomArtApplet.java">RandomArtApplet.java</a></span>, and

   demonstrates saving data from a program to a file in both binary and character form.  The
   program is a simple sketching program based on <span class="sourceref"><a href="SimplePaint2.java">SimplePaint2.java</a></span>.</li>
   
<li>
<span class="sourceref"><a href="ChatSimulation.java">ChatSimulation.java</a></span>, from <a href="../c11/s5.html">Section&nbsp;11.5</a> (on-line version only),
   is an applet that simulates a network chat.  There is no networking in this applet.  
   The only point is to demonstrate how
   a thread could be used to process (simulated) incoming messages.</li>
   
<li>
<span class="sourceref"><a href="GUIChat.java">GUIChat.java</a></span>, from <a href="../c11/s5.html">Section&nbsp;11.5</a>, is a simple GUI program
   for chatting between two people over a network.</li>
   
<li>
<span class="sourceref"><a href="BuddyChat.java">BuddyChat.java</a></span>, <span class="sourceref"><a href="BuddyChatServer.java">BuddyChatServer.java</a></span>, 
   <span class="sourceref"><a href="BuddyChatWindow.java">BuddyChatWindow.java</a></span>, and <span class="sourceref"><a href="BuddyChatServerShutdown.java">BuddyChatServerShutdown.java</a></span>, 
   from <a href="../c11/s5.html">Section&nbsp;11.5</a>, represent a multithreaded server and a client program for
   the service that it offers.  The BuddyChatServer program is a non-GUI server that
   keeps a list of connected clients.  These clients are available to chat to other clients.
   The client program is BuddyChat.  Each client connects to the server and gets a list
   of other clients that are connected.  A BuddyChat user can request a connection to
   one of the other clients in the list; when a connection is made, a pair of BuddyChatWindows
   is used for chatting between the two clients.  (The server has no part in the chat
   connections.)  BuddyChatServerShutdown can be used to shut down the server cleanly.
   This example is not scalable; that is, it should only be used for fairly small numbers
   of clients.  There is absolutely no defense against denial of service attacks, such as
   someone opening a very large number of connections. It is just an example of 
   basic client/server programming using threads.</li>
   
<li>
<span class="sourceref"><a href="XMLDemo.java">XMLDemo.java</a></span>, from <a href="../c11/s6.html">Section&nbsp;11.6</a>, is a simple
   program that demonstrates basic parsing of an XML document and traversal of the Document Object
   Model representation of the document.  The user enters the XML to be parsed in
   a text area.  The nested class <span class="code">XMLDemo.XMLDemoApplet</span> runs the
   program as an applet.</li>
   
<li>

   The first program uses an invented XML language, while the second uses an
   <span class="classname">XMLEncoder</span> for writing files and an <span class="classname">XMLDecoder</span>
   for reading files.  These programs are modifications of <span class="sourceref"><a href="SimplePaintWithFiles.java">SimplePaintWithFiles.java</a></span>.</li>

<li>
<span class="sourceref"><a href="TransparencyDemo.java">TransparencyDemo.java</a></span>, from <a href="../c12/s2.html">Section&nbsp;12.2</a>, demonstrates

<li>
<span class="sourceref"><a href="SillyStamper.java">SillyStamper.java</a></span>, from <a href="../c12/s4.html">Section&nbsp;12.4</a>, demonstrates using
   a <span class="classname">JList</span> of <span class="classname">Icons</span>.  The user can "stamp" images

   from <a href="../c12/s4.html">Section&nbsp;12.4</a>, implement a simple web browser using <span class="classname">JEditorPane</span>
   (which is ridiculously easy).  The difference between the programs is that the first
   loads documents synchronously, which can hang the program in an unpleasant way, while
   the second uses a thread to load documents asynchronously.</li>
   
<li>
<span class="sourceref"><a href="SimpleRTFEdit.java">SimpleRTFEdit.java</a></span>, mentioned but just barely discussed
   in <a href="../c12/s4.html">Section&nbsp;12.4</a>, lets the user edit RTF files, which are text files in

<a name="source.4">Part 4: Required Auxiliary Files</a>
</h3>


<p>This section lists some of the extra source files that are required by
various examples in the previous sections, along with a description of each
file. The files listed here are those which are general enough to be potentially useful in
other programming projects.  All of them are also referred to above, along
with the programming examples that depend on them.</p>


<ul>
   
   
<li>
<span class="sourceref"><a href="TextIO.java">TextIO.java</a></span> defines a class containing some
   static methods for doing input/output. These methods make it easier to use the
   standard input and output streams, <span class="code">System.in</span> and <span class="code">System.out</span>.
   <span class="classname">TextIO</span> also supports other input sources and output destinations,
   such as files.  Note that this version of <span class="classname">TextIO</span> is new with the fifth
   edition of this textbook and requires Java 5.0 (or higher).  The
   <span class="classname">TextIO</span> class defined by this file will be useless on a system that
   does not implement standard input, and might be inconvenient to use in integrated development environments such
   as Eclipse in which standard input works poorly. In that case, you might want to use
   the following file instead.</li>
   
   
<li>
<span class="sourceref"><a href="TextIO-GUI/TextIO.java">TextIO.java for GUI</a></span> defines an
   alternative to the preceding file. It defines a version of <span class="classname">TextIO</span> with the same set of
   input and output routines as the original version. But
   instead of using standard I/O, this GUI version opens its own window, and the
   input/output is done in that window.  Please read the comments at the beginning
   of the file. (For people who have downloaded this book: The file is located in
   a directory named TextIO-GUI inside the source directory.)</li>
   
   
<li>
<span class="sourceref"><a href="TextIOApplet.java">TextIOApplet.java</a></span> can be used for writing applets that simulate
   <span class="classname">TextIO</span> applets.  This makes it possible to write applets that use
   "console-style" input/output.  Such applets are created as subclasses of <span class="classname">TextIOApplet</span>.
   See the comments in the file for more information about how to convert a TextIO
   program into a TextIOApplet applet.  An example can be found in the file
   <span class="sourceref"><a href="Interest3Console.java">Interest3Console.java</a></span>.</li>
   
   
<li>
<span class="sourceref"><a href="TextReader.java">TextReader.java</a></span> can be used to "wrap" an input stream in
   an object that makes it easy to read data from the stream.  A <span class="classname">TextReader</span>
   object has basically the same input methods as the <span class="classname">TextIO</span> class.
   The <span class="classname">TextReader</span> class is introduced in <a href="../c11/s1.html#IO.1.4">Subsection&nbsp;11.1.4</a>
</li>

   
<li>
<span class="sourceref"><a href="SimpleAnimationApplet2.java">SimpleAnimationApplet2.java</a></span>, a
   class that can be used as a framework for writing animated applets. To use the
   framework, you have to define a subclass of <span class="classname">SimpleAnimationApplet2</span>.
   <a href="../c3/s8.html">Section&nbsp;3.8</a> has an example.</li> 
     
   
<li>
<span class="sourceref"><a href="Mosaic.java">Mosaic.java</a></span> contains subroutines for opening and controlling a
   window that contains a grid of colored rectangles.  It depends on <span class="sourceref"><a href="MosaicCanvas.java">MosaicCanvas.java</a></span>.
   This is a toolbox for writing simple stand-alone applications that use a "mosaic window".  This
   is rather old code, but it is used in examples in <a href="../c4/s6.html">Section&nbsp;4.6</a>
