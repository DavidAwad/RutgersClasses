<p>
<span class="start"><big>I</big>n this short section</span>, we look at
<span class="newword">assertions</span>, another feature of the Java programming
language that can be used to aid in the development of correct and
robust programs.</p>
   

<p>Recall that a precondition is a condition that must be true at a certain
point in a program, for the execution of the program to continue correctly from
that point.  In the case where there is a chance that the precondition might not
be satisfied -- for example, if it depends on input from the user -- then
it's a good idea to insert an <span class="code">if</span> statement to test it.
But then the question arises, What should be done if the precondition does not
hold? One option is to throw an exception. This will terminate the program,
unless the exception is caught and handled elsewhere in the program.</p>
   

<p>In many cases, of course, instead of using an <span class="code">if</span> statement to 
<i>test</i> whether a precondition holds, a programmer tries to write the program
in a way that will <i>guarantee</i> that the precondition holds.  In that case,
the test should not be necessary, and the <span class="code">if</span> statement can be
avoided.  The problem is that programmers are not perfect.  In spite of the programmer's
intention, the program might contain a bug that screws up the precondition.
So maybe it's a good idea to check the precondition -- at least during the
debugging phase of program development.</p>


<p>Similarly, a postcondition is a condition that is true at a certain point in the program 
as a consequence of the code that has been executed before that point.  Assuming
that the code is correctly written, a postcondition is guaranteed to be true,
but here again testing whether a desired postcondition is <b>actually</b> true
is a way of checking for a bug that might have screwed up the postcondition.
This is something that might be desirable during debugging.</p>
   

<p>The programming languages C and C++ have always had a facility for adding
what are called <span class="newword">assertions</span> to a program. These
assertions take the form "<span class="code">assert(</span><span class="bnf">condition</span><span class="code">)</span>", 
where <span class="bnf">condition</span> is a <span class="ptype">boolean</span>-valued expression. This
condition expresses a precondition or postcondition that should hold at that point in the program.
When the computer encounters an assertion during the execution of the program,
it evaluates the condition. If the condition is false, the program is
terminated.  Otherwise, the program continues normally.  This allows the
programmer's belief that the condition is true to be tested; if if it not
true, that indicates that the part of the program that preceded the assertion
contained a bug.  One nice thing about assertions in C and C++ is that they can be
"turned off" at compile time. That is, if the program is compiled in one way,
then the assertions are included in the compiled code. If the program is
compiled in another way, the assertions are not included. During debugging, the
first type of compilation is used. The release version of the program is
compiled with assertions turned off. The release version will be more
efficient, because the computer won't have to evaluate all the assertions.</p>
   

<p>Although early versions of Java did not have assertions, an assertion facility similar 
to the one in C/C++ has been available in Java since version 1.4.  As with the
C/C++ version, Java assertions can be turned on during debugging and turned off
during normal execution.  In Java, however, assertions are turned on and off
at run time rather than at compile time.  An assertion in the Java source code
is always included in the compiled class file.  When the program is run in the normal
way, these assertions are ignored; since the condition in the assertion is not
evaluated in this case, there is little or no performance penalty for having the
assertions in the program.  When the program is being debugged, it can be run
with assertions enabled, as discussed below, and then the assertions can be
a great help in locating and identifying bugs.</p>
   


<hr class="break">
   

<p>An <span class="newword">assertion statement</span> in Java takes one of the following two forms:</p>
   

<pre>assert <span class="bnf">condition</span> ;</pre>
  

<p>or</p>
    

<pre>assert <span class="bnf">condition</span> : <span class="bnf">error-message</span> ;</pre>


<p>where <span class="bnf">condition</span> is a <span class="ptype">boolean</span>-valued expression
and <span class="bnf">error-message</span> is a string or an expression of type <span class="classname">String</span>.
The word "<span class="code">assert</span>" is a reserved word in Java, which cannot be used as
an identifier.  An assertion statement can be used anyplace in Java where a statement is legal.</p>
   

<p>If a program is run with assertions disabled, an assertion statement is equivalent to
an empty statement and has no effect.  When assertions are enabled and an assertion statement
is encountered in the program, the <span class="bnf">condition</span> 
in the assertion is evaluated.  If the value is <span class="code">true</span>, the program proceeds normally.
If the value of the condition is <span class="code">false</span>, then an exception of type
<span class="code">java.lang.AssertionError</span> is thrown, and the program will crash (unless the
error is caught by a <span class="code">try</span> statement).  If the <span class="code">assert</span> statement
includes an <span class="bnf">error-message</span>, then the error message string becomes the message
in the <span class="classname">AssertionError</span>.</p>
   

<p>So, the statement "<span class="code">assert <span class="bnf">condition</span> : <span class="bnf">error-message</span>;"</span> is
similar to</p>   
   

<pre>if ( <span class="bnf">condition</span> == false )
    throw new AssertionError( <span class="bnf">error-message</span> );</pre>
   

<p>except that the <span class="code">if</span> statement is executed whenever the program is
run, and the <span class="code">assert</span> statement is executed only when the program is
run with assertions enabled.</p>
   

<p>The question is, when to use assertions instead of exceptions? The general
rule is to use assertions to test conditions that should definitely be true,
if the program is written correctly.  Assertions are useful for testing a program 
to see whether or not it is correct and for finding the errors in an incorrect program.
After testing and debugging, when the program is used in the normal way, the
assertions in the program will be ignored.  However, if a problem turns up later,
the assertions are still there in the program to be used to help locate the
error.  If someone writes to you to say that your program doesn't work when
he does such-and-such, you can run the program with assertions enabled, do
such-and-such, and hope that the assertions in the program will help you
locate the point in the program where it goes wrong.</p>
   

<p>Consider, for example, the <span class="code">root()</span> method from <a href="../c8/s3.html#robustness.3.3">Subsection&nbsp;8.3.3</a>
that calculates a root of a quadratic equation.  If you believe that your program will
always call this method with legal arguments, then it would make sense to write the
method using assertions instead of exceptions:</p>
   

<pre>/**
 * Returns the larger of the two roots of the quadratic equation
 * A*x*x + B*x + C = 0, provided it has any roots.  
 * Precondition: A != 0 and B*B - 4*A*C &gt;= 0.
 */
static public double root( double A, double B, double C )  {
   assert A != 0 : "Leading coefficient of quadratic equation cannot be zero.";
   double disc = B*B - 4*A*C;
   assert disc &gt;= 0 : "Discriminant of quadratic equation cannot be negative.";
   return  (-B + Math.sqrt(disc)) / (2*A);
}</pre>


<p>The assertions are not checked when the program is run in the normal way.  If you
are correct in your belief that the method is never called with illegal arguments,
then checking the conditions in the assertions would be unnecessary.  If your belief
is not correct, the problem should turn up during testing or debugging, when the program is
run with the assertions enabled.</p>
   

<p>If the <span class="code">root()</span> method is part of a software library that you
expect other people to use, then the situation is less clear.  Sun's
Java documentation advises that assertions should <b>not</b> be used for checking
the contract of public methods:  If the caller of a method violates the contract
by passing illegal parameters, then an exception should be thrown.  This will enforce
the contract whether or not assertions are enabled.  (However, while it's true
that Java programmers <i>expect</i> the contract of a method to be enforced with
exceptions, there are reasonable arguments for using assertions instead, in some
cases.)</p>
   

<p>On the other hand, it never hurts to use an assertion to check a postcondition
of a method.  A postcondition is something that is supposed to be true after
the method has executed, and it can be tested with an <span class="code">assert</span> statement at the
end of the method.  If the postcodition is false, there is a bug in the method
itself, and that is something that needs to be found during the development
of the method.</p>
   

<hr class="break">


<p>To have any effect, assertions must be <b>enabled</b> when the program is run.
How to do this depends on what programming environment you are using.  (See
<a href="../c2/s6.html">Section&nbsp;2.6</a> for a discussion of programming environments.)
In the usual command line environment, assertions are enabled by adding the 
option <span class="code">-enableassertions</span> to the <span class="code">java</span> command that 
is used to run the program.  For example, if the class that contains the main 
program is <span class="classname">RootFinder</span>, then the command</p>
   

<pre>java -enableassertions RootFinder</pre>


<p>will run the program with assertions enabled.  
The <span class="code">-enableassertions</span>
option can be abbreviated to <span class="code">-ea</span>, so the command can alternatively
be written as</p>
   

<pre>java -ea RootFinder</pre>
   

<p>In fact, it is possible to enable assertions in just part of a program.
An option of the form
"<span class="code">-ea:<span class="bnf">class-name</span></span>"
enables only the assertions in the specified class.  Note that there are no
spaces between the <span class="code">-ea</span>, the ":", and the name of the class.  To
enable all the assertions in a package and in its sub-packages, you can use
an option of the form "<span class="code">-ea:<span class="bnf">package-name</span>...</span>".
To enable assertions in the "default package" (that is, classes that are not specified to
belong to a package, like almost all the classes in this book), use
"<span class="code">-ea:...</span>".  For
example, to run a Java program named "MegaPaint" with assertions enabled for every class
in the packages named "paintutils" and "drawing", you would use the command:</p>


<pre>java  -ea:paintutils...  -ea:drawing...  MegaPaint</pre>
   

<p>If you are using the Eclipse integrated development environment, you can
specify the <span class="code">-ea</span> option by creating a <span class="newword">run configuration</span>.
Right-click the name of the main program class in the Package Explorer pane,
and select "Run As" from the pop-up menu and then "Run..." from the
submenu.  This will open a dialog box where you can manage run configurations.
The name of the project and of the main class will be already be filled in.
Click the "Arguments" tab, and enter <span class="code">-ea</span> in the box
under "VM Arguments".  The contents of this box are added to the <span class="code">java</span>
command that is used to run the program.  You can enter other options
in this box, including more complicated <span class="code">enableassertions</span> options such 
as <span class="code">-ea:paintutils...</span>.  When you click the "Run" button,
the options will be applied.  Furthermore, they will be applied whenever
you run the program, unless you change the run configuration or add a
new configuration.  Note that it is possible to make two run configurations
for the same class, one with assertions enabled and one with assertions
disabled.</p>
