<p>
<span class="start"><big>I</big>n previous chapters</span>, we have covered the fundamentals
of programming. The chapters that follow will cover more advanced aspects of
programming.  The ideas that are presented will be a little more complex and
the programs that use them a little more complicated.  This chapter is
a kind of turning point in which we look at the problem of getting such complex
programs <i>right</i>.</p>
   

<p>Computer programs that fail are much too common.
Programs are fragile. A tiny error can cause a program to misbehave or crash.
Most of us are familiar with this from our own experience with computers. And
we've all heard stories about software glitches that cause spacecraft to crash,
telephone service to fail, and, in a few cases, people to die.</p>


<p>Programs don't have to be as bad as they are. It might well be impossible to
guarantee that programs are problem-free, but careful programming and
well-designed programming tools can help keep the problems to a minimum. This
chapter will look at issues of correctness and robustness of programs. It
also looks more closely at exceptions and the <span class="code">try..catch</span>
statement, and it introduces <span class="newword">assertions</span>, another of the 
tools that Java provides as an aid in writing correct programs.</p>
   

<p>This chapter also includes sections on two topics that are only indirectly
related to correctness and robustness.  <a href="../c8/s5.html">Section&nbsp;8.5</a>
will introduce <span class="newword">threads</span> while <a href="../c8/s6.html">Section&nbsp;8.6</a>
looks briefly at the <span class="newword">Analysis of Algorithms</span>.  Both of these
topics do fit into this chapter in its role as a turning point, since they
are part of the foundation for more advanced programming.</p>
