<span class="start"><big>C</big>omputer programs are</span> only useful if they interact
with the rest of the world in some way. This interaction is referred to as
<span class="newword">input/output</span>, or <span class="newword">I/O</span>. 
Up until now, this book has concentrated on just one 
type of interaction: interaction with the user, through either a
graphical user interface or a command-line interface. But the user is only one
possible source of information and only one possible destination for
information. We have already encountered one other type of input/output, since
<span class="classname">TextIO</span> can read data from files and write data
to files.  However, Java has an input/output framework that provides much
more power and flexibility than does <span class="classname">TextIO</span>,
and that covers other kinds of I/O in addition to files.  Most importantly,
it supports communication over network connections.
In Java, input/output involving files and networks is based on
<span class="newword">streams</span>, which are objects that support I/O
commands that are similar to those that you have already used.
In fact, standard output (<span class="code">System.out</span>) and
standard input (<span class="code">System.in</span>) are examples of streams.</p>


<p>Working with files and networks requires familiarity with exceptions, which
were covered in <a href="../c8/index.html">Chapter&nbsp;8</a>. Many of
the subroutines that are used can throw exceptions that require mandatory
exception handling. This generally means calling the subroutine in a
<span class="code">try..catch</span> statement that can deal with the exception if one
occurs.</p>
